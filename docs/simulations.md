# Running Simulations

## All Atom Simulations
There are several great resources online. For now we defer to these resources, but we do [outline the core steps](md/index.md) in running a simulation that one needs to be familiar with.

## Coarse Graining
The construction of suitable coarse grained models is discussed [here](cg/index.md). Both phenomenological and systematic routes are discussed.

## Field Theory
Field theory is conducted using the PolyFTS package. Guides to getting started can be found [here](fieldtheory/index.md).
