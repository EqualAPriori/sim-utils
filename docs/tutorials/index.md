# Tutorials

This section is meant to be a running list of case studies and work based on this workflow, with short summaries of key lessons from each. These case studies with increasing complexity to demonstrate both the end-to-end simulation work flow.

## Case Studies
### 1. Bulk water: Nearly incompressible liquids
For example coarse graining, see this [pure water](water/index.md) page.

### 2. Dodecane: Understanding bonding
For example coarse graining, see this [dodecane](dodecane/index.md) page.

### 3. Methanol-Water: Mixtures
For example coarse graining, see this [methanol-water mixture](methanol_water/index.md) page.

### 4. NaCl Solution: Incorporating electrostatics
For example coarse graining, see this [NaCl](salt/index.md) page.

### 5. SDS: Microstructure forming systems
For example coarse graining, see this [SDS](SDS/index.md) page.

### 6. PEO: Temperature dependence and phase separation
For example coarse graining, see this [PEO](PEO/index.md) page.

### 7. Polyelectrolyte Systems: Coacervation
For a sample system, see this page studying [polyacrylic acid (PAA) and poly-allyl-amine (PAH)](PE/index.md).

### 8. Biological peptide systems
