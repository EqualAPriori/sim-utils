and polyallylamine

are very simple, standard polyelctrolyte chains, widely used in systematic studies on [polyelectrolyte coacervation, (Chollakup et al. 2010)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma902144k).

In this set of case studies we coarse grain every monomer to a single bead, and explore the coacervation phase diagram.
