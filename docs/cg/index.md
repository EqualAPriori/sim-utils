# Coarse Graining a System

## Phenomenological models
### Model 1: Helfand compressibility with $\chi$ parameters
This is the typical model used in polymer field theory models.

### Model 2: Asymmetric bead volumes, the general excluded volume model
This model is a generalization of the Helfand compressibility model.

## Systematic coarse graining with the relative entropy
We provide standard tools for rapidly setting up coarse-grained simulations using the `mdfts` software package.

Core steps of coarse graining involve:

1. mapping
2. running relative entropy minimization
3. converting to field theory inputs
